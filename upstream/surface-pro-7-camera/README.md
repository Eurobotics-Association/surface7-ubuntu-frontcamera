# Surface Pro 7 Camera for Linux

Experimental camera support for the rear OV8865 and front OV5693 RGB
cameras of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7.

This repository contains the complete known-good source delta and
userspace integration used on a real Surface Pro 7 running Fedora 43.

## Status

Tested working:

- Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (without Plus)
- Fedora Workstation 43
- linux-surface kernel 6.19.8-3
- rear OV8865 camera
- DW9719 focus actuator
- front OV5693 RGB camera
- Intel IPU4P
- libcamera SimplePipeline + CPU SoftISP
- PipeWire / WirePlumber
- GNOME Snapshot
- Signal Desktop through v4l2loopback

This is experimental hardware support, not a generic Surface camera
driver.

## Camera profiles

Five camera profiles are provided:

| Profile | Output | Approx. / nominal rate | Intended use |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| Rear Standard | 1628x1224 | 30 fps | Rear default |
| Rear HQ | 3260x2448 | 14.25 fps | Rear maximum resolution |
| Rear Fast | 1404x792 | 60 fps | Rear high frame rate |
| Front Standard | 1292x972 | 57.344 fps | Front default |
| Front HQ | 2588x1944 | 25 fps | Front high resolution |

GNOME Snapshot consumes the native PipeWire/libcamera camera nodes.

V4L2 applications such as Signal can use all five virtual cameras through:

- /dev/video80 — Rear Standard
- /dev/video81 — Rear HQ
- /dev/video82 — Rear Fast
- /dev/video83 — Front Standard
- /dev/video84 — Front HQ

The rear and front cameras share the physical IPU camera path. Only one
real physical camera stream is therefore selected at a time.

## Architecture

Native applications:

    OV8865 rear / OV5693 front
      -> Intel IPU4P
      -> libcamera SimplePipeline
      -> CPU SoftISP
      -> PipeWire
      -> WirePlumber
      -> application

V4L2-only applications:

    OV8865 rear / OV5693 front
      -> Intel IPU4P
      -> libcamera / PipeWire
      -> SP7 on-demand controller
      -> idle relay
      -> v4l2loopback
      -> /dev/video80 ... /dev/video84
      -> application

The controller starts a real camera stream only when a V4L2 client
actually opens one of the virtual cameras.

## Installation

The known-good configuration is Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (without Plus),
Fedora Workstation 43 and kernel 6.19.8-3.surface.fc43.x86_64.

For the tested Fedora configuration:

    ./check-system.sh
    ./install.sh

Other distributions and kernel versions have not yet been tested. The
camera implementation itself is not intended to be Fedora-specific.

Experienced SP7 users can deliberately opt into experimental testing:

    ./check-system.sh --allow-untested-distro
    ./install.sh --allow-untested-distro

In this mode the hardware and safety checks remain active, but packages
are not installed automatically. Install the equivalent build/runtime
dependencies for your distribution first.

The flag can also be combined with the non-installing build test:

    ./install.sh --build-only --allow-untested-distro

Results from other distributions are very welcome.

## Source bases

The exact upstream commits are recorded in:

    docs/source-bases.txt

The release currently uses:

- Linux stable 6.19.8 source base
- the SP7 IPU4P driver source base recorded in docs/source-bases.txt
- libcamera source base recorded in docs/source-bases.txt
- v4l2loopback v0.15.4 without local source modifications

v4l2loopback already contains the CLIENT_USAGE private event used by
the on-demand controller. No v4l2loopback source patch is required.

## Known limitations

### Front IR camera

The validated front-camera support covers the OV5693 RGB camera. The
separate front IR camera is outside the scope of this project.

### One physical stream

The rear OV8865 and front OV5693 share the IPU camera resources. The
five V4L2 cameras are therefore virtual profiles, not five
simultaneously usable physical streams.

The on-demand controller arbitrates globally between all five V4L2
profiles. The most recent client-usage transition selects the active
physical camera profile.

### Snapshot and Signal at the same time

The V4L2 controller does not control native PipeWire/libcamera clients.
Nevertheless, simultaneous GNOME Snapshot and Signal operation was
successfully tested in the final validation.

This does not imply that independent rear and front physical sensor
streams can run concurrently.

### Autofocus

Continuous contrast-detection autofocus is implemented and works, but
it is still relatively slow.

### Automatic exposure

Automatic exposure works, but adaptation can also be slow.

### Fast profile

The Fast profile is intended primarily for good lighting. Low-light
colour reproduction is currently worse than Standard and HQ.

### Signal preview

Signal may mirror the local preview because the v4l2loopback devices
appear as generic webcams. The camera pipeline itself does not apply a
horizontal flip.

## Release policy

Version 0.1.x deliberately preserves the code that was tested on the
known-good machine, including some diagnostic logging.

Cleanup and refactoring should be separate changes and should be
re-tested before becoming part of a later release.

## Safety

The camera kernel modules are tied to a specific kernel ABI.

Do not install modules built for another kernel.

The known-good installer configuration is:

    Fedora Workstation 43
    6.19.8-3.surface.fc43.x86_64

The default path refuses untested distribution/kernel combinations.
With --allow-untested-distro, experienced users can deliberately test
other combinations. The Surface Pro 7 hardware check, x86_64
requirement, IPU4P check, matching kernel build tree and Secure Boot
protection remain enforced.

External modules are built for the running kernel and their vermagic is
checked before installation.
